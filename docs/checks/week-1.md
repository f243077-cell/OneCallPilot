# Week 1 — checks and progress

> Evidence for Phase 0 and Week 1 (`phases.md` §5, §9, §11). The Friday checkpoint section is filled in on Friday.

## Phase 0 progress — Stream A (Tanzeel)

| Task | Status | Date | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| S0.2 Repo skeleton (shared) | done (on `tanzeel`) | 2026-10-09 | Folders per `CLAUDE.md` §3, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, CODEOWNERS (informational), PR template. Branch protection on `main`: Tanzeel, by hand, after the first PR exists. |
| S0.3 CI skeleton | done (on `tanzeel`) | 2026-10-09 | Six workflows with stable job names; `contracts.yml` runs real contract checks. |
| A0.2 Contracts C4, C6, C7 | drafted (on `tanzeel`) | 2026-10-09 | `contracts/actions.yaml`, `contracts/python/oncallpilot_contracts/ledger.py`, `contracts/telemetry.md`; contract tests green. Reader: Usman. |
| A0.3 Flutter project | done (on `tanzeel`) | 2026-10-09 | Package `com.tanzeel.oncallpilot`, minSdk 24, `FlutterFragmentActivity`, generated network security config (debug/profile only). `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` green. |
| A0.1 Firebase project | done | 2026-10-09 | Android app registered with package `com.tanzeel.oncallpilot`. `mobile/android/app/google-services.json` is present locally, git-ignored (`.gitignore:7`), not staged, not tracked, and in no commit; its `package_name` equals the `applicationId`. Not used by the app yet (no Firebase packages added). |
| S0.5 Network spike | prepared; phone test pending | 2026-10-09 | `docs/checks/network.md` |
| S0.6 Docker Desktop | done on Tanzeel's laptop | 2026-10-09 | Below |
| S0.7 (a) socket-proxy-rw part | done | 2026-10-09 | `docs/checks/proxy.md` — TEST-015 rw part 12/12 against the real proxy |

## S0.6 — Docker Desktop (Tanzeel's laptop)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Docker Desktop engine | 29.8.1, WSL2 backend (kernel 6.18.40.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2) |
| Docker API version | 1.56 (min 1.40) |
| Docker Compose | v5.5.1 (`include:` needs ≥ 2.20) |
| CPUs / memory visible to Docker | 4 / 7.69 GiB (WSL default: half of host RAM; no `.wslconfig`) |
| Host RAM | 15.9 GB reported by Windows |
| Disk image | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\wsl\disk\docker_data.vhdx` on C: (15.3 GB; C: has 136 GB free, so it was not moved) |

**Open point:** the docs plan the integration and benchmark host as a 20 GB laptop (ADR-03), and §12.3 asks for at least 8 GB for Docker. This laptop reports 15.9 GB and gives Docker 7.69 GiB. Before the benchmark, either confirm the RAM figure or raise Docker's memory with a `.wslconfig` (for example `memory=10GB`) and record the change here.

## Friday checkpoint (W1)

_To be filled in: stack boots with one command; phone reaches the laptop._
